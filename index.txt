Jacob - 1

Current:
I am a senior working towards a bachelors degree in Computer Science with an emphasis on Core Computer Science. Hopefully I will be graduating in Spring 2020.

Background:
I have done some small projects when I went to Platte County High School to get myself a start at the different areas of computer science. I originally wanted to get into game design but found myself not being fond of it once I had actually taken a course on it in high school. I found myself looking fondly on Data Management when I took some courses here at NWMSU. Unfortunately some of the classes that I would need to take to finish that emphasis area were not available this semester so I had to switch to a core computer science emphasis. I have worked a lot with many different languages like Java, Javascript, Python, HTML, etc. and have plenty of experience in each.

Future:
I am hoping that I can get a job in a data management center once I graduate. My dream job would be to work at a space exploration/advancement organization such as NASA or SpaceX. I have always had a love for space and the wonders that it can bring and I have wanted to be a part of the advancement of that for a long time. 

Some interesting things about me is that I play Trombone in the BMB and I have lived in Germany for seven years of my life.
