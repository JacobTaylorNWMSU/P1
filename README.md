## About

I will use this repository to share some information about myself and to share tools and resources that someone could use to learn web development and markdown.

## Recommended Tools
Aside from getting a github profile in order to create repositories you would need internet and a web browswer. I would say that Google Chrome is a good browswer to get as it has a lot of options of what you can do with it, but it's also up to preference if you wanted to get Firefox or Microsoft Edge. Git Bash is a great tool to use as you can use it straight from your file explorer and can be connected between your code and your git hub account. Finally Visual Studio Code is a absolute recommendation as you can use this to create projects in many different languages, it's able to connect straight to git as well, and has plenty of useful extensions avaible to install.

- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=Cj0KCQjw753rBRCVARIsANe3o44WuY4nYtPJltWqdo-q6BfJKBdjeP-ARLLCB5knBA7f-X04KDptFysaAn1KEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
    - You wouldn't need to know any languages in order to navigate around the web browser. But it would help to have a quick typing speed to be able to use it efficiently

- [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)
    - It would be very useful if you knew how to navigate file folders and a starting grasp on Bash usage. If you don't have any experience with using Bash then you can follow this link to get started on learning some basics.
        - [Git-Bash Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-bash)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - With this tool it's a bit different than the others as there are many different languages you could use this for. But you would need to know how to use Markdown (Which a little cheatsheet can be found down in the resources to help with that) in order to be able to create a git page. 

## Recommended Resources
Some of these resources are useful you want to learn to remember markdown, but you can also use places like Stack Overflow to find more specific information about really anything programming. I would also recommend Khan Academy, a resource that I used back in high school that can freely help someone learn topics like math and computing. 

- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links)
    - This cheatsheet is great because you will be able to find out how you implement certain elements in markdown that you may forget.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
    - Stack overflow is just a great place to get answers to any and all questions you may have while you work on development. It is also likely that the same issues that you've encountered may have been answered already on here, so it's worth a shot to look around. Just be sure to properly lay out your questions when you try to ask a question.
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming)
    - This is a pretty simple place to start at. It's free which is a plus, and it has step by step learning that leads into new and more advanced topics.
