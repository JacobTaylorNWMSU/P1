## About

I will use this repository to share some information about myself and to share tools and resources that someone could use to learn web development and markdown.

## Recommended Tools
Aside from getting a github profile in order to create repositories you would need internet and a web browswer. I would say that Google Chrome is a good browswer to get as it has a lot of options of what you can do with it, but it's also up to preference if you wanted to get Firefox or Microsoft Edge. Git Bash is a great tool to use as you can use it straight from your file explorer and can be connected between your code and your git hub account. Finally Visual Studio Code is a absolute recommendation as you can use this to create projects in many different languages, it's able to connect straight to git as well, and has plenty of useful extensions avaible to install.

## Recommended Resources
Some of these resources are useful you want to learn to remember markdown, but you can also use places like Stack Overflow to find more specific information about really anything programming. I would also recommend Khan Academy, a resource that I used back in high school that can freely help someone learn topics like math and computing. 
- [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links)
    - This cheatsheet is great because you will be able to find out how you implement certain elements in markdown that you may forget.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
    - Stack overflow is just a great place to get answers to any and all questions you may have while you work on development. It is also likely that the same issues that you've encountered may have been answered already on here, so it's worth a shot to look around. Just be sure to properly lay out your questions when you try to ask a question.
- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming)
    - This is a pretty simple place to start at. It's free which is a plus, and it has step by step learning that leads into new and more advanced topics.
